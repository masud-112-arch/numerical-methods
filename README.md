# numerical-methods
This repository contains implementations of numerical methods in python, with applications in physics and CFD.
The goal is to create a structured collection of theory notes, Python code, and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how numerical algorithms work step by step.

Implemented Methods
Euler's methods
Improved Euler's method 
Runge-Kutta method 
Stability and Convergence analysis
Diffusion equation(1D heat equation)
Navier-Stokes(2D cavity flow)

Future Scope
This repo will be expanded to cover:
Finite Difference Method
Finite Volume Method
Matplotlib Animation
